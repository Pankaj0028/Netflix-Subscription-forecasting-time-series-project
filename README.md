## Project Description
Netflix has consistently seen growth in its subscriptions. This project aims to:
- Analyze subscription trends over different time periods.
- Train and evaluate a Linear Regression model to forecast future subscription numbers.
- Provide data-driven insights to understand subscription growth patterns.

## Dataset
The dataset contains subscription data for Netflix, including:
- Time periods (e.g., quarters or years)
- Total number of subscribers
- Quarterly or annual growth rates

### Data Preprocessing
The dataset was cleaned and processed to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Features were engineered to derive meaningful insights.

## Key Features
- **Subscription Trend Analysis**: Visualization of subscriber growth trends over time.
- **Growth Rate Calculation**: Analysis of quarterly and annual growth rates.
- **Forecasting**: Predicting future subscription numbers using a trained Linear Regression model.
- **Visualization**: Dynamic and static visualizations to communicate insights.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Linear Regression

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-subscriptions-forecasting.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd netflix-subscriptions-forecasting
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Future Improvements
- Use more complex machine learning models for better forecasting accuracy.
- Incorporate external factors (e.g., market trends, competition) into the model.
- Develop a dashboard for real-time forecasting and visualization.

## Conclusion
The Netflix Subscription Forecasting project was a comprehensive analysis aimed at understanding and predicting Netflix's subscription trends. By leveraging historical data and applying machine learning techniques, specifically Linear Regression, we were able to achieve meaningful insights into subscription growth and future trends.
